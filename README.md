# My Rosalind Journey
## 17 Oct. 2021
### Today I finished 5 problems:
- Counting DNA Nucleotides
- Transcribing DNA into RNA
- Complementing a Strand of DNA
- Rabbits and Recurrence Relations
- Mortal Fibonacci Rabbits

The first three problems wasn't challenging. Yet, the recurrence problem is a bit tricky, especially the Mortal Fibanacci Rabbits problem. I spend a lot of time trying to figure out the relation and the code, but my laptop somehow wasn't able to produce the result in time. In the end, I have to write another program which uses while loop to compute for this problem.
The problems also helped me review the algorithm that I learned a couple of days ago in bioinfo class, which was also about Fibonacci sequence and recurrence. This is the perfect practice to refresh one's memory:)

- Computing GC Content
- Calculating Expected Offspring
- Counting Point Mutations
- Mendel First Law
- Translating RNA into Protein

While solving these questions, the major problem that I encountered is to install the python packages such as biopython and np. The integration of home brew and vscode seems to be a bit off. When selecting different intepreters, the package can sometimes disappear. Anyway, there's no problem running them in termial, which is much easier though less convenient.
